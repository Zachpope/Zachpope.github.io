# Stuff about me

I went to Hilton High School before this year. As far as hobbies go, I'd say I'm a fan of d&d, archery in the fall, as well as games. I currently work two jobs to fund my way through college, one at a bar, the other at a pizza place. There isn't much else to me, really, so I'll leave my introduction there.
